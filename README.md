This is a small project to extract data in a table on Wikipedia into R and clean 
it into something pretty usable for myself (and maybe other folks). Beware, there 
is some loss of accuracy in the dates to try and conform it to the format of the 
rest of the data (see `130` vs `130+`), as well as the lack of images and references 
present in the original Wikipedia page.
